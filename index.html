                        description: "As part of my work, I developed an official application for Real Madrid stores using Swift in Xcode. \The goal was to enhance the in-store customer experience through an interactive and engaging digital platform. The app includes gamification, location-based offers, a digital collection system, visit-based rewards, and a secure login system using email and password. To build this project, I leveraged several tools. Swift and Xcode were used for the core development of the app, ensuring a native and optimized experience for iOS users. Softr Studio played a crucial role in creating a data analysis page linked to the application. Airtable was used as the primary database to manage user information and store promotions, while Zapier was implemented to automate processes, making the app more efficient and reducing manual work. One of the biggest challenges was implementing real-time data updates for the news section, ensuring users always had access to the latest information. Additionally, optimizing UX/UI was a key focus to make navigation seamless and intuitive. Another important aspect was the integration of No-Code tools like Softr and Airtable, which allowed for rapid iteration and reduced development time. Automating processes with Zapier also streamlined operations, minimizing the need for manual input and enhancing overall efficiency. Throughout this project, I gained valuable experience in combining traditional development with No-Code solutions, allowing me to focus on high-impact features while leveraging automation to handle repetitive tasks.",

                        description: "I developed a stock market price prediction model using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks to forecast Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock prices. Using the Yahoo Finance API, I collected five years of historical stock data, including not only closing prices but also technical indicators like moving averages, RSI, volatility, and volume changes. These additional features provided a more comprehensive dataset for training. To prepare the data, I applied MinMax scaling for normalization and created 30-day sequences to capture long-term dependencies. The dataset was split 80% for training and 20% for testing. I designed a deep learning model with bidirectional LSTM layers, dropout for regularization, and Huber loss to enhance prediction stability. The model was trained using Adam optimization and included early stopping and checkpointing to prevent overfitting. Once trained, the model was evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and RÂ² score, providing insights into prediction accuracy. To visualize results, I plotted actual vs. predicted prices and implemented a function to forecast stock prices for the next seven days based on the last available data. This project allowed me to refine my deep learning skills for time series forecasting, improve feature engineering for financial models, and optimize LSTM architectures for real-world applications. I also gained experience in integrating technical indicators into machine learning models to enhance prediction accuracy.",

The dataset was cleaned, missing values were handled, and relevant features were engineered to improve predictive accuracy. To predict an authorâs future impact, I implemented multiple machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

User authentication is handled through Firebase Authentication and Firestore for data persistence, while I included custom components like MacroCircleView to visualize nutrient percentages. The food search functionality is powered by the Edamam API, providing detailed nutritional information with asynchronous image loading and error handling. The food details view includes an interactive portion selector with real-time macronutrient calculations when users modify their serving size.

                        description: "For this project, I implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the Fashion-MNIST dataset. Fashion-MNIST is a widely used benchmark dataset consisting of 70,000 grayscale images (28x28 pixels) of clothing items, such as t-shirts, dresses, sneakers, and bags. The main objective was to build a deep learning model capable of accurately distinguishing between the 10 different classes in the dataset. I used TensorFlow and Keras to construct the CNN architecture, leveraging multiple convolutional layers to extract spatial features from the input images. The preprocessing pipeline involved normalizing the pixel values to a range of [0,1] to improve convergence during training. The dataset was split into 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, ensuring that the model was evaluated on unseen data. To enhance model generalization, I also applied batch normalization and dropout layers. The architecture consisted of multiple Conv2D layers with ReLU activation functions, followed by MaxPooling layers to reduce dimensionality while preserving important features. A Flatten layer converted the extracted feature maps into a fully connected layer, culminating in a Softmax output layer for multi-class classification. For optimization, I utilized the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 and categorical cross-entropy as the loss function. The model was trained over 20 epochs with a batch size of 64, monitoring its performance through accuracy and loss metrics. To prevent overfitting, I introduced L2 regularization and dropout layers, ensuring that the network learned robust representations rather than memorizing training data. After training, the model achieved an accuracy of approximately 91% on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in recognizing fashion items. To evaluate the model, I generated a confusion matrix and a classification report, analyzing precision, recall, and F1-score for each class. Some misclassifications were observed between similar categories, such as dresses and t-shirts, indicating potential improvements with more complex architectures or data augmentation techniques. Future work could explore transfer learning with pre-trained models like MobileNetV2 or ResNet to enhance performance. This project reinforced my expertise in deep learning, CNNs, and image classification while providing valuable insights into model optimization and deployment.",
